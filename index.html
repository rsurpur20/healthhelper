  <h3 id="uses"> Our Purpose </h3>
  <p id= "usesText"> <b> To begin we were inspired by a previous Girls Who Code final project called Pocket Doctor. However, we wanted to make our page a little different and more specific. We also wanted to make our website easier to manage
    so that almost anyone at any age could go in and use it. Our solution was to add pictures and icons that when hovered over would show what it was about. To continue, we also
    added locations in New York City to find hospitals in the area.
